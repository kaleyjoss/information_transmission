# This repository contains data and code to replicate the findings from the paper entitled _Hunter-gatherer foraging networks promote information transmission_. 
The agent-based model used in the paper is available as "**central_place_model.ipynb**". The original model by Ramos-Fernández et al (Ramos-Fernández, G., Boyer, D. & Gómez, V.P. A complex social structure with fission–fusion properties can emerge from a simple foraging model. Behav Ecol Sociobiol 60, 536–549 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-006-0197-x) is in the file named **"Ramos-Fernández_model.py"**. 

The data from the multiple parameter combinations can be found in the folder, **Data**. 

The code to analyze the frequency and distance of logistic and residential moves is available in **Mobility_plots.ipynb**. 

The code to analyze emergent networks for efficiencies and contagion analyses is available in **organized_efficiencies_contagion.Rmd** and **revision_tests.R**. The networks formed can be visualized by accessing the folder **network_animations**. 

The folder **gifs** contains plots to visualize how foragers in the model moved in the environment, and the code to make those plots is available in **Trajectory_analysis.ipynb**.
